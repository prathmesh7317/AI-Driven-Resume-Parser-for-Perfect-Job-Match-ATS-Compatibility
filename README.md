# AI-Driven-Resume-Parser-for-Perfect-Job-Match-ATS-Compatibility

## **Problem Statement**:

Job seekers often struggle to create resumes that align with job descriptions (JDs), which can significantly reduce their chances of getting shortlisted. Traditional methods of resume analysis are often time-consuming and ineffective in providing tailored feedback. This project addresses the gap by using AI-powered resume parsing combined with cosine similarity and ATS scoring to automatically assess a resumeâ€™s fit for a job role. It offers job seekers instant insights into how well their resume matches the job description, highlights missing skills, and provides recommendations for improvement, enhancing their chances of securing interviews. This tool helps streamline the application process for both job seekers and recruiters.


## Project Overview:

This project allows job seekers to upload their resumes and match them against job descriptions (JD). Using OCR for text extraction and NLP for skill detection, it calculates a cosine similarity score and ATS score. Based on the scores, it provides feedback and categorizes resumes for potential shortlisting. Resumes with scores above 60% are saved in a specific folder for further HR review. The system also suggests resume improvements and exports extracted data to a CSV file. It's designed to help candidates enhance their resumes for better job opportunities. The project also includes a CSV export feature for HR analysis and provides **Gemini AI-powered feedback** on improving resumes. Candidates with a similarity score above 60% are categorized as potential shortlists for further action.
